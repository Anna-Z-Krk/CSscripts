# Export To EaselJS

Exports a naming-convention based PSD file to a spritesheet for use with EaselJS projects.

While usable as is, this script is intended to be a test script for an upcoming panel based extension.

###Usage

Copy the `jssxbin` file along with the corresponding two template files to the directory of your choice, or directly to the Photoshop Script folder, and run against a properly formed sprite file.
